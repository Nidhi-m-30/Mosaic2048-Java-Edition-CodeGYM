# Mosaic2048-Java-Edition-CodeGYM
This repository contains the code for a simple implementation of the classic 2048 puzzle game in Java which was made on CodeGYM. The game's title, "2048", holds significance. It's a nod to the mathematical power of two raised to the 11th power. Everything within the game operates on powers of two.
This game's allure lies in its accessibility. It's incredibly easy to play, whether in a browser or on a smartphone. 
Here's the link to play the game:

Gameplay Mechanics:
Here's a quick rundown of the game's simple yet addictive rules:
- You're presented with a 4x4 board composed of square tiles.
- Each round, a tile with a value of 2 (90% probability) or 4 (10% probability) appears on the board.
- All tiles can be shifted in one of four directions.
- When two tiles with the same value "collide", they merge, resulting in the doubling of the tile's value.
- The ultimate goal? Attain a tile with the value of 2048.
- The game ends when no more moves are possible.

Features:
Addictive Gameplay: Experience the classic sliding tile game with a challenging twist.
Scoring System: Keep track of your high scores and aim for the highest tile possible.
Responsive Design: Play seamlessly across various screen sizes and devices.
